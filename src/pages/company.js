                  GGS Niagara Landscaping Inc. offers full service landscape
                  maintenance and garden design. After completing Niagara
                  Collegeâ€™s Landscape Technician program in 2013 my career in
                  the industry took off. Since that time I have worked with
                  different companies as a crew supervisor looking after some of
                  Niagara's finest landscapes. Over the years I have kept up
                  with the latest trends and knowledge to ensure each client
                  gets the best possible service.

                  From using organic bee safe fertilizer, to water management
                  practices not only will you have a beautiful landscape but it
                  will also be healthy, and good for the planet. With Nearly 10
                  years in the landscape industry I have learnt a lot about what
                  works and what doesn't, this can help save you time and money
                  by making sure the work is done right the first time.
